tbmm-2014-12-11sit01spe0002par0064	Mr. President, I have made a commitment to express the views of the National Movement Party on the presidential budget. I salute the High Council. The 2015 central management budget we're talking about is a blessing for our nation, for our country. Dear MPs, I am a congressman who has repeatedly criticised the current President's predecessor, who has expressed my criticism in an open letter addressed to the president's budget and to the person I share with the public. During the seven years of the presidency, I believed that there could be no worse than the late President, who could not go beyond loyalty to my brother Abdullah Gül, and today I am a congressman who understood that he was wrong. Dear lawmakers, after leaving their post, you also served in the former President Gul, who gave an interview to the newspaper Saudi El Hayat, and you also served in opposition, and you lived in the Presidential Mansion, which was more difficult? The Presidential Mansion was the hardest. You represent everyone, and if you are aware of that, the presidency is the most difficult; it's easy if you don't realize it. Mr. Erdogan, who took into account the warnings of the challenge of his neutral presidency, has eliminated this challenge in his own way, as he continues to act as AKP President rather than try to be neutral. In accordance with Article 103 of the Constitution, he saw that swearing on honor and honor that he would be neutral was clearly a trivial matter. Despite his oath of honor and honor, the President did not feel the need to change himself. If his oath and authority have not changed him, then if he is determined to be as he was, then it is up to us to continue to see him as he was. We must remember for a moment that Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdogan is what he was before he became President. So again, it's the polarist, it's the separatist, it's the separatist, it's the aberrant again, it's the one who ignores national interests for personal gains, it's the one who doesn't hesitate to use religious values, it's the one who cares about neither judicial independence nor press freedom, it's the one who wants to drown every criticism with pride. I pray for the American soldiers who turn the Middle East into a pool of blood. The person who says, "I'm responsible for marketing my country." The person who says, "I'm the co-chair of the Great Middle East Project." The person who says, "I'm the wife of the Great Middle East Project." The person who says, "I've never been in contact with a terrorist organization. I pray for American soldiers to return to their countries." It's a disgrace to say so. The person who said, "It's a solution" is the person who puts the country's reputation in shoeboxes, and it's the human president who's going to stay in our memories, and we're talking about his budget. It's a fact that a man who doesn't feel that he belongs to Turkish history, a great Turkish nation and his history, has taken an oath of honor and honor, and his budget is being discussed. We all know that under the circumstances, living in a mansion or in a palace, raising its budget by 50 or 100 per cent, and since the Court's reports didn't come to Parliament, it's only a matter of time now that we won't know where this budget will go. Congressmans, the government's skirts are on fire to prevent waste in public, while the public institutions' funds are expected to increase only 4-4.5%, while the presidential budget is nearly doubled compared to the previous year, because it was made for the president's office, not for the president's office. The goal is not to meet the needs of the presidency, but to satisfy the President's ambitions. You know that the most common place of satisfaction of these ambitions is also a rallying ground. What we're talking about, in fact, is Mr. Erdogan's election budget for 2015. No one would be surprised if Mr. Erdogan, who had no problem with "discriminate," wanted to use his breath in his lungs at the presidency to inflate the AKP's sails. The person entrusted with the prime minister's office will be able to digest the situation, first to show its capacity for digestion. However, searching for the answer to the question we will address to the President should be considered to be a political regret for each of us: "If your style in the presidency is correct, why did you not allow the President of your prime minister to act as you are now acting? If you think your prime minister is the right example, why don't you allow the current prime minister to act the same way? It is now known that he will carry the emphasis. What everyone doesn't know is what this score really means and who's the real deal. These statements, which carry a message to his account, are actually highlighting the position of the Prime Minister, not the President. I am the elected President of the people. In fact, you are simply the Prime Minister chosen by me. It is clear to him that at his party's consultation, when he speaks of Mr. Erdoğan, he calls himself the President of the State. Then what are you?" as long as he maintains his position, Mr. Davutoglu will pursue him. Congressmans, I don't know if he'll be ashamed of it or boastful, but if we don't address the court's curiosity about the current President, the portrait of Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdogan will not be completed. As it is known, Mr. Erdogan, who completed his warm-up tours in Dolmabahçe and Beysbe's palaces, did not find an Ottoman palace worthy of his fame in Ankara, and built him a palace of more than 1.5 billion rooms. As much as the cost of this palace, including corruption, the unlawfulness of the structure has been discussed. In his early prime minister's years, it was clear that anyone who claimed that the house in Skopjedar was a fugitive would not have to worry about the legality of his dwelling, whether it was a slum or a palace. As for rumors of irregularity and corruption in the production business, we now have enough experience to believe that they will have no difficulty resolving these rumors. Engels "One thinks in another palace in a hut." he said. Obviously, that didn't apply to Mr. Erdogan. He knows how to keep his mind alive in the slum and in the palace. Speaking of "intellectual," let it not be forgotten that this court's affluence stems from the mentality that Mr. Erdogan belongs to rather than from the person he belongs to. As it is known, the former President wanted to move the items he liked in the Dolmabahce Palace to the Presidential Mansion, and we discussed that for a while. The current President is just an embodiment of this mentality. But let's face it, he's carrying out his own mentality with such determination that we should sit at Topkapi Palace and be thankful that he doesn't see Gülhane as a coupon land. Dear lawmakers, the corruption that is all connected to each other, the process of dissolution in order to order the judiciary, the resolution of the terrorist leader's solution partnership, the foreign policy that turns our borders into hell, the national education policies that preach our future to raise a spiteful generation, not only in order to be corrupt, but also the rich in power, and the pool media that are created to them, and so on, Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdogan's power. He owns all of this under the name "New Turkey" and gives himself a sense of pride. What really makes you dizzy is the presence of the masses that pledge to him at all costs. Religious rhetoric has created the mass that previous practices have said is hard to keep at home by combining the feelings of hatred and material gain that they have created in individuals. Yes, it's a job that's been overcome, but it's not a job to brag about. Go tell Ali that he has tens of thousands of men calling the male camel a she-camel." It doesn't make you a better man than a man who speaks his word. Let him not forget that anecdot which contains these words is not an example of a situation that can be used as an example, and I hereby salute the High Assembly once again.
