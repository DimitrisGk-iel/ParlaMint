ParlaMint-ES-GA_2017-05-24-DSPG030.u1	Good morning, let's start the session. Let us resume the session with agenda item 6, which corresponds to questions for oral reply by the President of the Union. Ask Mr. President of the Galician Council of Da Ana Belén Pontón Mondelo, G.P. of the Galego Nationalist Block, on the actions planned by the Government of Greece to avoid the sale by Ferroatlantica of the hydroelectric power stations of the river Xallas
ParlaMint-ES-GA_2017-05-24-DSPG030.u2	You have the floor to Mrs. Pontón.
ParlaMint-ES-GA_2017-05-24-DSPG030.u375	They were several.
ParlaMint-ES-GA_2017-05-24-DSPG030.u376	No, one. No, no, sorry. [[Murmurs.]] Look, I'm going to tell you something, we're going to finish this in peace, I'm going to tell you what happened, because I was in the debate. It was precisely that the People's Parliamentary Group was prepared to vote on its non-law proposal, because it was an inclusive debate, provided that the amendment of En Marea was not included. This is what happened. As the amendment of En Marea was included, the proposal to be voted on by the People's Parliamentary Group could not be voted on. There was no inaccuracy, I was attentive to the debate. [[Murmurs.]] That's right. [[Murmurs.]] We're suspending... There wasn't... I'm telling you, there wasn't... We're suspending the full. See you tomorrow.
