ParlaMint-ES-GA_2019-10-08-DSPG130.u1	Good morning. Let's start the session. Good morning, the session is open. The agenda is published in the Official Bulletin of the Parliament of Galicia, so we do not proceed to its reading. He justified his inattentiveness to this full-time wife Concepción Burgo. We go into the agenda with the first point, which are legislative texts. Comprehensive discussion of the draft law on measures to guarantee supply in droughts and health risk situations
ParlaMint-ES-GA_2019-10-08-DSPG130.u2	Amendments have been made to the whole at the request of the Joint Parliamentary Group, the Parliamentary Group on the Nationalist Block in Wales and the Joint Parliamentary Group on the Left. For the presentation of the bill, the adviser to Infrastructure and Mobility, Ms. Ethel Vázquez Mourelle, has the floor.
ParlaMint-ES-GA_2019-10-08-DSPG130.u461	Mr Bará, I should review your speech because it is such a disincentive, such a disincentive, that it is not really worthy of this Parliament. [[Murmurs.]] Either he comes here to talk seriously about Vulcan workers and Barreras, or he comes here to make demagogy that doesn't go anywhere. [[Applause]] Because, of course, Mr Bará, your intervention will not solve any problem either one job or one Vulcan or Barreras, none. [[Applause]] From there, if you like, we'll talk about Vulcano. I've been totally transparent to Vulcan workers ever since. From the first moment the Galician Union, in 2017, pushed a financial structure that allowed the ferry to complete, and gave Vulcan a loan so that the ferry could be completed. And the Galician Union collaborated and made a technical tutelage. Listen, from there, where's the responsibility? I say it'll be from the yard, I say! The yard has a debt of 200 million euros. Who wants to charge that responsibility? To whom? [[Murmurs.]] I've been totally honest with the workers. [[Murmurs.]] With this situation, logically, it's very difficult. 200 million euros of losses? What do you want, what do we nationalize, what do you want? [[Speak words that are not perceived.]] Maybe... do you want that? [[Murmurs.]] [[Speak words that are not perceived.]] No, no, no, no. Here's a responsibility because we manage the resources of the Greeks and all the productive sectors. And from there on, Your Honor, if there's an investor in Vulcan who's willing, in the settlement plan, to give him continuity and there's a solvent project we'll support it. [[Applause]] And if there isn't a solvent project, logically, don't ask for irresponsibility, like, by the way, you did with Alfageme, remember? 32 million euros to public finances. [[Murmurs.]] From there, if you want, we'll talk about Barreras. Look, we've already moved to the shipowner and yard that we're not going to admit any partial solution. And, logically, we're going to support any kind of proposal that allows us to develop the workload, because there's a responsibility in the sector and there's also a responsibility for its impact on the auxiliary industry. We'll be with Barriers, like we were with Vulcan and how we were with the sector. I remind you here who was the Government that proposed the solutions to the problem of tax read, I remind you who collaborated in the search for workload and I remind you who has destined 50 million euros - this government - precisely to measures related to innovation and training. Mr Bará, lessons on the naval sector, none. I just hope your proposals don't have to develop on the part of any Government of the Galician Union because, unfortunately, they won't serve anyone. [[Applause]] Nothing more and thank you very much.
ParlaMint-ES-GA_2019-10-08-DSPG130.u462	Thank you very much, Mr. Conde. We'll hold the session until tomorrow at ten in the morning.
